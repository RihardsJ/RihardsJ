## Hello I'm Rihards and Welocme to my Github page! 👋

### My history

Back in 2008 I have graduated Riga State Technical school as a [Programming Technician](https://www.rvt.lv/eng/department/computer/study-programm). There I first time develop deep interest in coding. The studies also allowed me to gain basic knowledge about software development through **Pascal** and **C++**. Life made some corrections and instead of becoming a developer I have moved to UK and worked in hotel industry. Luckly I have recieved a second chance in my life to chace my dream of becoming a web developer. I have been accepted into brilliant community of Founders and Coders where I am intensively developing my coding skills.

### Currently

- 🎯 My goal is to build my portfolio, become a junior web developer, and start my life long journey in software development industry.

I am passionate tech-head who is learning web-development in "Founders and Coders" and looking for an opportunity to become a developer. 
Prior coding I have worked in luxury five-star hotels in London. That experience allowed me to meet from different backgrounds, build my communication and teamwork skills as well as to develop my organisational skills. I liked what I have done but I did not feel that I am making any impact. Before moving to London
I have graduated technical school in my home country Latvia. During my studies, I was creating some small projects in Pascal and C++. I enjoyed it a lot and always wanted to build my future in relation to my studies. In my free time I enjoy watching technology-related documentaries such as "AlphaGo" or "Terms and Conditions may apply".  I would be happy for an opportunity in the future to work on projects which would improve our society, help to improve healthcare, make people life easier or would help to defeat local or global disasters.
