I am passionate tech-head who is learning web-development in "Founders and Coders" and looking for an opportunity to become a developer. 
Prior coding I have worked in luxury five-star hotels in London. That experience allowed me to meet from different backgrounds, build my communication and teamwork skills as well as to develop my organisational skills. I liked what I have done but I did not feel that I am making any impact. Before moving to London
I have graduated technical school in my home country Latvia. During my studies, I was creating some small projects in Pascal and C++. I enjoyed it a lot and always wanted to build my future in relation to my studies. In my free time I enjoy watching technology-related documentaries such as "AlphaGo" or "Terms and Conditions may apply".  I would be happy for an opportunity in the future to work on projects which would improve our society, help to improve healthcare, make people life easier or would help to defeat local or global disasters.
